cRacklet - A boundary integral library for interfacial rupture simulations
##########################################################################

*cRacklet* cRacklet is a C++ boundary integral library based on a spectral formulation of the dynamic wave equations in two semi-infinite linearly elastic solids. Its implementation is specially tailored for the modeling of dynamic crack/rupture propagation along a planar interface bonding the two half-spaces. The main benefit of this spectral method is a numerical discretization limited to the mid-plane, thereby providing a very fine description of the dynamic rupture processes, unattainable with finite-element or finite-difference schemes. For more details about the method and its applications, refer to "related publications" section.
