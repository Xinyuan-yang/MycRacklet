	abstract = {In recent years, the interest in the problem of brittle fracture and, in particular, in the theory of cracks has grown appreciably in connection with various technical applications. Numerous investigations have been carried out, enlarging in essential points the classical concepts of cracks and methods of analysis. The qualitative features of the problems of cracks, associated with their peculiar nonlinearity as revealed in these investigations, makes the theory of cracks stand out distinctly from the whole range of problems in terms of the theory of elasticity. The chapter presents a unified view of the way basic problems in the theory of equilibrium cracks are formulated and discusses the results obtained thereby. The object of the theory of equilibrium cracks is the study of the equilibrium of solids in the presence of cracks. However, there exists a fundamental distinction between these two problems, The form of a cavity undergoes only slight changes even under a considerable variation in the load acting on a body, while the cracks whose surface also constitutes a part of the body boundary can expand even with small increase of the load to which the body is subjected.},
