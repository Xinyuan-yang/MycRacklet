# Summary

The study of dynamically propagating rupture along faults is of prime importance in fields ranging from engineering to geosciences. Numerical simulations of these phenomena are computationally costly and challenging: a fine discretization in time and space is required to accurately represent the singularities associated with the rupture edges. At the same time, the problems of interest usually involve a larger length scale along which rupture will propagate (i.e. a tectonic fault), consequently leading to a large domain of study requiring a fine discretization. In addition, the behavior of such interfaces can be highly non-linear thus increasing the problem complexity. Conventional numerical approaches for fracture problems, for instance, the use of cohesive elements in the finite-element method [@ortiz_finite-deformation_1999], requires discretizing the whole body containing the fault and is consequently computationally expensive. The use of boundary integral methods, reducing the dimensionality of the problem, enable to focus the computational efforts on the fracture plane and allows for a detailed description of the interfacial field's evolution.

# Statement of need

`cRacklet` is a C++ library with a Python interface [@pybind11] developed as a collaboration between the Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory at EPFL and the Department of Aerospace Engineering of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that implements a spectral formulation of the elastodynamics boundary integral relations between the displacements and the corresponding traction stress acting at a planar interface between two homogeneous elastic solids [@geubelle_spectral_1995], [@breitenfeld_numerical_1998]. The stresses acting on the interfaces are partly computed with a convolution of the history of the interfacial displacement in the Fourier domain. The convolutions are computed within a shared-memory parallel framework using FFTW3/OpenMP. The prescription of an interfacial behavior allows solving for the equilibrium at a given time step. Time integration is achieved using an explicit time-stepping scheme. cRacklet is aimed at researchers interested in interfacial dynamics, ranging from nucleation problems to dynamic propagation of rupture fronts.

# Features

cRacklet allows for planar rupture interface simulations loaded in any combination of normal traction, in-plane, and out-of-plane shear solicitations.  cRacklet handles the simulation of interfaces bonded between dissimilar elastic solids. Any stress or material heterogeneity along the fracture plane can be resolved using cRacklet. Several interfacial behaviors are included in the library, such as:

- Slip-weakening laws [@ida_cohesive_1972] [@palmer_growth_1973]. This behavior can be coupled with a classical Coulomb friction law or a regularized one [@prakash_frictional_1998] to handle friction emerging from the contact of the two surfaces.

- Rate and state dependant friction laws, including the original formulation by [@dieterich_modeling_1979] and [@ruina_slip_1983]. More novel formulations such as rate and state friction with velocity-strengthening behaviors (i.e. N-shaped) are also available, see [@barsinai_2014] for example.


# Performance
