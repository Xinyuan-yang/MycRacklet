# Summary

The study of dynamically propagating rupture along faults is of prime importance in fields ranging from engineering to geosciences. Numerical simulations of these phenomena are computationally costly and challenging: a really fine discretisation in time and space is required to accurately represent singularity and discontinuity, but at the same time the domain of study may be several order of magnitude larger. In addition, the behavior of such interfaces is often highly non-linear thus increasing the problem complexity.

Boundary integral methods are commonly used to solve 

Boundary integral methods.



The numerical method allows for a detailed description of the evolution of the interacial fields especially in the failure zone captured with the aid of a failure model.

# Statement of need

`cRacklet` is a C++ library with a Python interface developed as a collaboration between the Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory at EPFL and the the Department of Aerospace Engineering of the niversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that implements a spectral formulation of the elastodynamics boundary integral relations between the displacements and the corresponding traction stress acting at a planar interface between two solids. [@geubelle_spectral_1995] , [@breitenfeld_numerical_1998]. The interfacial stress in this formulation is partly given by a convolution of the history of the displacement fields and these convolutions are computed efficiently using pre-computed kernel and parallel computation using FFTW3/OPENMPI. 

cRacklet is aimed at researchers studying rupture dynamics ...

# Features

cRacklet allows for planar rupture interface simulations loaded in any directions. cRacklet handle the simulation of interfaces bonded between dissimilar elastic solids. Any stress or material heterogeneity along the fracture plane can be resolved using cRacklet. Several interfacial behavior are included in the library, such as:

- slip-weakening [ref] with the possibility to coupled with standard Coulomb

- several formulation of the rate and state dependant friction laws [Ruina & Dieterich + regularized?]. 

We are not aware of any public software package including the implementation of the so-called spectral formulation of the elastodynamics boundary integral equations.
